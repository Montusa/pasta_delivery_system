# Ideas for (possible) future implementation

### Agregar direcci√≥n de entrega del pedido y titular o nombre del que lo pide + codigo de seguridad para reconocer al cliente.

1. Add pre-made dishes as options instead of costumizing the whole dish. Some would need to be ready-to-eat and some other may be "shipped" as frozen or fresh.
  + 1.1) Also add a rating system for pre-made dishes
2. Take orders directly from whatsapp. Maybe through a bot?
3. Build an interface for clients to log in, self-service and view the state of their orders.
